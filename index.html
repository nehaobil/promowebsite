<h2>Steve Lacy is a songwriter, singer, and producer. He is part
of an R&B group called The Internet, and also makes individual music.</h2>
<p>He has worked with big artists such as Tyler The Creator, Kali Uchis,
and many more.</p>
<p>Impressively enough, a majority of his music has been produced by him
by simply using his iPhone and garageBand. He created an entire demo
with only his phone, showing how talented he is at creating music!</p>
